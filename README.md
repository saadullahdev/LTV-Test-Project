# Intial Setup

    docker-compose build
    docker-compose up mariadb
    # Once mariadb says it's ready for connections, you can use ctrl + c to stop it
    docker-compose run short-app rails db:migrate
    docker-compose -f docker-compose-test.yml build

# To run migrations

    docker-compose run short-app rails db:migrate
    docker-compose -f docker-compose-test.yml run short-app-rspec rails db:test:prepare

# To run the specs

    docker-compose -f docker-compose-test.yml run short-app-rspec

# Run the web server

    docker-compose up

# Adding a URL

    curl -X POST -d "full_url=https://google.com" http://localhost:3000/short_urls.json

# Getting the top 100

    curl localhost:3000

# Checking your short URL redirect

    curl -I localhost:3000/abc

# Algorithm for url shortening

    * Used ID of the full-url record to generate its short-code
    * It is bidirectional supported (full-url to short-url and short-url to full-url)
